# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models in Python. The dataset is highly imbalanced, reflecting real-world fraud detection challenges.

## 📊 Overview

- **Dataset:** Credit card transactions from Kaggle.
- **Objective:** Classify transactions as fraudulent or valid.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

## 🔍 Process

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
2. **Fraud vs Valid Transaction Analysis**
3. **Correlation Heatmap**
4. **Model Training:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.
5. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

## 🚀 Results

- Built an effective fraud detection model.
- Handled class imbalance and visualized transaction patterns.
- Achieved reliable performance metrics.
